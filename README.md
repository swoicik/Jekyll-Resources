# Jekyll Resources
I recently started a new writing project on GitHub. Part of this project was building a website to show the work. Since most of the work was on GitHub, a Jekyll site powered by GitHub pages seemed like a good fit. And a good way to learn more about the hype around static site generators (coming from a longtime WordPressusers). 

While researching and learning how to build my own Jekyll site on GitHub pages, I came across a lot of themes, tutorials, plugins, and other sites using Jekyll. Rather than just save all this research for myself to eventually forget, this repository is an attempt to consolidate a lot of the information and save time for anyone trying the same thing I did. 

If you want to view my own work and progress with Jekyll, the repository is https://github.com/swoicik/cyod/tree/gh-pages and the GutHub page site is https://cyod.xyz. 

If you have any Jekyll Resources of your own, please create an issue or pull request. Thanks.
